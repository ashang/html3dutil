is used on each face of the box.

#### Parameters

    Width of the box.
* `ySize` (Type: Number)<br>
    Height of the box.
* `zSize` (Type: Number)<br>
    Depth of the box.

### H3DU.Meshes.createCapsule(radius, length, slices, stacks, middleStacks, flat, inside) <a id='H3DU_Meshes_createCapsule'></a>

Creates a mesh of a capsule, centered at the origin.
The length of the capsule will run along the z-axis. (If the capsule
has a high length and a very low radius, it will resemble a 3D line
with rounded corners.)
Will also generate texture coordinates.
See the "<a href="tutorial-shapes.md">Creating Shapes</a>" tutorial.

    Radius of each spherical end of the capsule. May be null or omitted, in which case the default is 1.
* `length` (Type: Number)<br>
    Length of the middle section. May be null or omitted, in which case the default is 1. If this value is 0, an approximation to a sphere will be generated.
* `slices` (Type: Number)<br>

    Number of horizontal sections each spherical half consists of. May be null or omitted, in which case the default is 8.

    If true, the normals generated by this method will point inward; otherwise, outward. Should normally be false unless the capsule will be viewed from the inside.

#### Return Value
