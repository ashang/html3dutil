### H3DU.Meshes()

Contains methods that create meshes
of various geometric shapes and solids.

coordinates are generated, it is assumed that the coordinate (0,0)
is at the lower-left corner of the texture and (1,1) is at the upper-right
corner.

<a name='H3DU.Meshes.createBox'></a>
### (static) H3DU.Meshes.createBox(xSize, ySize, zSize, [inward])

Creates a mesh of a box (rectangular prism), which
will be centered at the origin.
See the "<a href="tutorial-shapes.md">Creating Shapes</a>" tutorial.
Will create texture coordinates such that the same texture
is used on each face of the box.

#### Parameters

* `xSize` (Type: number)<br>Width of the box.
* `ySize` (Type: number)<br>Height of the box.
* `zSize` (Type: number)<br>Depth of the box.
* `inward` (Type: Boolean) (optional)<br>If true, the normals generated by this method will point inward; otherwise, outward. Should normally be false unless the box will be viewed from the inside.

#### Return Value

The generated mesh. (Type: <a href="H3DU.Mesh.md">H3DU.Mesh</a>)

<a name='H3DU.Meshes.createCapsule'></a>
### (static) H3DU.Meshes.createCapsule([radius], [length], [slices], [stacks], [middleStacks], [flat], [inside])

Creates a mesh of a capsule, centered at the origin.
The length of the capsule will run along the Z axis. (If the capsule
has a high length and a very low radius, it will resemble a 3D line
with rounded corners.)

Will also generate texture coordinates such that the V (vertical)
coordinates start from the bottom of the texture and increase from the negative
to positive Z axis, and the U (horizontal) coordinates start from the left of the
texture and increase from the positive X to positive Y to negative X to negative
Y to positive X axis.

If the "length" parameter is 0, the X, Y, and Z coordinates of a point on the solid
are as described in <a href="H3DU.Meshes.md#H3DU.Meshes.createSphere">H3DU.Meshes.createSphere</a>.
See the "<a href="tutorial-shapes.md">Creating Shapes</a>" tutorial.

* `length` (Type: number) (optional)<br>Length of the middle section. May be null or omitted, in which case the default is 1. If this value is 0, an approximation to a sphere will be generated.
* `slices` (Type: number) (optional)<br>Number of vertical sections the capsule consists of. This function will create an octahedron if "slices" is 4 and "stacks" is 2. Must be 3 or greater. May be null or omitted, in which case the default is 16.

be centered at the origin and its height will run along the
positive Z axis. The base and top will be included in the mesh if
their radius is greater than 0. Will generate texture coordinates for
the cylinder and for the base and top.
The base's and top's texture coordinates will be such that the
texture will be flat as seen from either.

See <a href="H3DU.Meshes.md#H3DU.Meshes.createCylinder">H3DU.Meshes.createCylinder</a> for information on how texture
coordinates for the cylinder (other than the base and top) are generated and how
to find the coordinates of a particular point on the cylinder.

See the "<a href="tutorial-shapes.md">Creating Shapes</a>" tutorial.

<a name='H3DU.Meshes.createConvexHull'></a>
### (static) H3DU.Meshes.createConvexHull(An, [flat], [inside])

Generates the convex hull of a set of points, that is, the smallest convex set
that contains all the points given.

To use this method, you must include the script "extras/convex.js". Example:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="extras/convex.js"></script>

#### Parameters

* `An` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>array of 3-element vectors each identifying a 3-dimensional point.

<a name='H3DU.Meshes.createCylinder'></a>
### (static) H3DU.Meshes.createCylinder(baseRad, topRad, height, [slices], [stacks], [flat], [inside])

Creates a mesh of a cylinder. The cylinder's base will
be centered at the origin and its height will run along the
positive Z axis. The base and top themselves will not be
included in the mesh.

Texture coordinates for the cylinder (other than the base) will
be generated such that the V (vertical)
coordinates start from the bottom of the texture and increase from the origin
to the positive Z axis, and the U (horizontal) coordinates start from the left of the
texture and increase from the positive X to positive Y to negative X to negative
Y to positive X axis.

The X, Y, and Z coordinates of a point on the cylinder are
<code>(R\*cos(&lambda;+&pi;), R\*sin(&lambda;+&pi;), H\*&phi;)</code>,
where &phi; = <code>(&pi;/2 + L)/&pi;</code>, L is the latitude in radians,
&lambda; is the longitude in radians, H = <code>height</code>,
R = <code>baseRad + (topRad - baseRad) \* &phi;</code>,
and west and south latitudes and
longitudes are negative. (The formula for converting latitude
and longitude is mentioned here because their meaning depends on
exactly how the texture coordinates are generated on the cylinder.
It assumes that in the texture, longitudes range from -180&deg; to 0&deg; to 180&deg; from
left to right, and latitudes range from 90&deg; to 0&deg; to -90&deg; from top to bottom.)

See the "<a href="tutorial-shapes.md">Creating Shapes</a>" tutorial.

#### Parameters

* `baseRad` (Type: number)<br>Radius of the base of the cylinder. If 0, this function will create an approximation to a downward pointing cone.
* `topRad` (Type: number)<br>Radius of the top of the cylinder. If 0, this function will create an approximation to an upward pointing cone.
* `height` (Type: number)<br>Height of the cylinder.
* `slices` (Type: number) (optional)<br>Number of lengthwise "slices" the cylinder consists of, each slice going through the center of the cylinder. This function will create a triangular prism if "slices" is 3 and both radiuses are the same; a triangular pyramid if "slices" is 3 and either radius is zero; a rectangular prism if "slices" is 4 and both radiuses are the same; and a rectangular pyramid if "slices" is 4 and either radius is zero. Must be 3 or greater. May be null or omitted, in which case the default is 32.
* `stacks` (Type: number) (optional)<br>Number of vertical stacks the cylinder consists of. May be null or omitted, in which case the default is 1.
* `flat` (Type: Boolean) (optional)<br>If true, will generate normals such that the cylinder will be flat shaded; otherwise, will generate normals such that the cylinder will be smooth shaded.
* `inside` (Type: Boolean) (optional)<br>If true, the normals generated by this method will point inward; otherwise, outward. Should normally be false unless the cylinder will be viewed from the inside.

See the "<a href="tutorial-shapes.md">Creating Shapes</a>" tutorial.

#### Parameters

Each Z coordinate is a Z coordinate of the point where the path lies, and each X coordinate is the radius of the figure at that point. The Z coordinates should be given in increasing order and should not be the same from one point to the next. This parameter's length must be 4 or greater and be an even number.
