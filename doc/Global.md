### * (constant)

Indicates to divide each other coordinate of the returned point
by the last coordinate of the point and omit the last
coordinate. This is used to convert
homogeneous coordinates to conventional coordinates.
If this bit is set, the length of each control point must be at least 2.

A B-spline curve that has control points whose last coordinate is other than
1 is a <i>rational</i> B-spline curve.
