Examples
---------
```javascript
  // Create the 3D scene; find the HTML canvas and pass it
  // to Scene3D.
  var scene=new Scene3D(document.getElementById("canvas"));
  // Create a box mesh 10 units in width, 20 units
  // in height, and 20 units in depth
  var mesh=Meshes.createBox(10,10,10);
  // Create a shape based on the mesh and give it a red color
  var shape=scene.makeShape(mesh).setColor("red");
  // Add the shape to the scene
  scene.addShape(shape);
  // Create a timer
  var timer={};
  // Set up the render loop
  GLUtil.renderLoop(function(time){
   // Set the perspective view.  Camera has a 45-degree field of view
   // and will see objects from 0.1 to 100 units away.
   scene.setPerspective(45,scene.getClientAspect(),0.1,100);
   // Move the camera back 40 units.
   scene.setLookAt([0,0,40]);
   // Update the shape's rotation
   var q=GLMath.quatFromTaitBryan(
     360*GLUtil.getTimePosition(timer,time,6000),
     360*GLUtil.getTimePosition(timer,time,12000),
     0
   );
   shape.setQuaternion(q);
   // Render the scene
   scene.render();
  });
```

History
---------

Version 1.5:

- Add support for specular maps and normal maps, including
 in the JSON mesh format and MTL material format.
- To support normal maps, extra methods for bitangents and
 tangents were added to the Mesh class.
- Added six new demos and modified several others
- Support 24-bit color versions of TGA files
- Scene3D now does frustum culling of its shapes
- Fixed vertex normal calculation in the recalcNormals()
 method of the Mesh class.
- Allow two-element arrays to be passed to the Mesh class's
 texCoord3() method.
- Add getBoundingBox method to the Mesh class.
- Add the setVisible method to the Shape and ShapeGroup
 classes.
- Allow reading OBJ files with negative reference numbers
- Add path.js (2D graphics paths) to extras
- Added an "axis" parameter to the SurfaceOfRevolution
 constructor and fromFunction method
- Add vec3negate, vec3negateInPlace, vec3mul, and plane
 and frustum methods to the GLMath class
- Deprecate the practice of setting shape materials directly
 to textures (calling the Shape#setMaterial method with a
 Texture object rather than a Material object).
- Deprecate certain properties of Transform that shouldn't
 be exposed as a public API and add corresponding methods
 for those properties
- Fix getPromiseResults
- Documentation added in many places
- "meshexamples.md" demo added and other demos edited
 or rearranged
- Other changes and fixes

Version 1.4:

- Fixed camera.js issues (thanks to the user "the-sz" on GitHub)
- Added an _extras_ folder with the following new scripts:
    - A CurveTube class for creating tubes from 3D curves
    - A parametric evaluator for surfaces of revolution and
      3 kinds of curves (_evaluators.js_)
    - A frame counter (moved from the demos)
    - A JSON converter and loader for 3D meshes (_meshjson.js_)
- Made _objmtl.js_ compatible with more MTL files
- Math.sin/Math.cos pairs were replaced with optimized
  versions throughout the code
- Add mat4transformVec3 method to GLMath
- Add BSplineCurve class
- Deprecate vertexBezier, normalBezier, colorBezier, and texCoordBezier
  methods of CurveEval and SurfaceEval
- Optimize SurfaceEval's evalSurface method when generating
  triangles
- Add primitiveCount and enumPrimitives methods to the Mesh
  class
- Add setMaterial and removeShape methods to the ShapeGroup class
- Default shader program now uses `modelViewMatrix` instead of
  separate `world` and `view` uniforms
- Fix JSON issues in GLUtil.loadFileFromUrl method
- Many new demos added
- Add graphics filters tutorial and expanded several other tutorials
