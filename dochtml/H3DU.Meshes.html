of various geometric shapes and solids.<p>

<h3> (static) H3DU.Meshes.createCylinder(baseRad, topRad, height, [slices], [stacks], [flat], [inside])</h3>Creates a mesh of a cylinder. The cylinder's base will
be centered at the origin and its height will run along the
positive Z axis. The base and top themselves will not be
included in the mesh.<p>
Texture coordinates for the cylinder (other than the base) will
be generated such that the V (vertical)
coordinates start from the bottom of the texture and increase from the origin
to the positive Z axis, and the U (horizontal) coordinates start from the left of the
texture and increase from the positive X to positive Y to negative X to negative
Y to positive X axis.<p>
The X, Y, and Z coordinates of a point on the cylinder are
<code>(R*cos(&lambda;+&pi;), R*sin(&lambda;+&pi;), H*&phi;)</code>,

&lambda; is the longitude in radians, H = <code>height</code>,
R = <code>baseRad + (topRad - baseRad) * &phi;</code>,
and west and south latitudes and
longitudes are negative. (The formula for converting latitude
and longitude is mentioned here because their meaning depends on
exactly how the texture coordinates are generated on the cylinder.
It assumes that in the texture, longitudes range from -180&deg; to 0&deg; to 180&deg; from
left to right, and latitudes range from 90&deg; to 0&deg; to -90&deg; from top to bottom.)<p>
