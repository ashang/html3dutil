<h3> H3DU.BezierCurve#accel(u)</h3>Finds an approximate acceleration vector at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>accel</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, does a numerical differentiation using
the velocity vector.<p>
The <b>acceleration</b> of a curve is a vector which is the second-order derivative of the curve's position at the given coordinate. The vector returned by this method <i>should not</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">unit vector</a>.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing an acceleration vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.BezierCurve_arcLength'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BezierCurve#arcLength(u)</h3>Finds an approximate arc length (distance) between the start of this
curve and the point at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>arcLength</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, calculates a numerical integral using the velocity vector.<p>
The <b>arc length</b> function returns a number; if the curve is "smooth", this is the integral, from the starting point to <code>u</code>, of the length of the velocity vector.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>The approximate arc length of this curve at the given U coordinate. (Type: number)<a name='H3DU.BezierCurve_changeEnds'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BezierCurve#changeEnds(ep1, ep2)</h3>Creates a curve evaluator object for a curve that is generated using
the same formula as this one (and uses the same U coordinates),
but has a different set of end points.
For example, this method can be used to shrink the path of a curve
from [0, &pi;] to [0, &pi;/8].<p>
Note, however, that in general, shrinking
the range of a curve will not shrink the length of a curve
in the same proportion, unless the curve's path runs at
constant speed with respect to time. For example, shrinking the range of a curve
from [0, 1] to [0, 0.5] will not generally result in a curve that's exactly half as
long as the original curve.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>ep1</code> (Type: number)<br>New start point of the curve.<li><code>ep2</code> (Type: number)<br>New end point of the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>Return value. (Type: <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a>)<a name='H3DU.BezierCurve_endPoints'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BezierCurve#endPoints()</h3>Returns the starting and ending U coordinates of this curve.<h4> Return Value</h4>A two-element array. The first and second
elements are the starting and ending U coordinates, respectively, of the curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.BezierCurve_evaluate'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BezierCurve#evaluate(u)</h3>Evaluates the curve function based on a point
in a B&eacute;zier curve.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>Point on the curve to evaluate (generally within the range given in the constructor).</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array of the result of
the evaluation. It will have as many elements as a control point, as specified in the constructor. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<h4> Example</h4><pre>// Generate 11 points forming the B&eacute;zier curve.
// Assumes the curve was created with u1=0 and u2=1 (the default).
var points=[];
for(var i=0;i<=10;i++) {
points.push(curve.evaluate(i/10.0));
}</pre><a name='H3DU.BezierCurve_fitRange'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BezierCurve#fitRange(ep1, ep2)</h3>Creates a curve evaluator object for a curve that follows the same
path as this one but has its U coordinates remapped to fit the given range.
For example, this method can be used to shrink the range of U coordinates
from [-&pi;, &pi;] to [0, 1] without shortening the path of the curve.
Here, -&pi; now maps to 0, and &pi; now maps to 1.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>ep1</code> (Type: number)<br>New value to use as the start point of the curve.<li><code>ep2</code> (Type: number)<br>New value to use as the end point of the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>Return value. (Type: <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a>)<a name='H3DU.BezierCurve_getLength'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BezierCurve#getLength()</h3>Convenience method for getting the total length of this curve.<h4> Return Value</h4>The distance from the start of the curve to its end. (Type: number)<a name='H3DU.BezierCurve_getPoints'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BezierCurve#getPoints(count)</h3>Gets an array of positions on the curve at fixed intervals
of U coordinates. Note that these positions will not generally be
evenly spaced along the curve unless the curve uses
an arc-length parameterization.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>count</code> (Type: number)<br>Number of positions to generate. Throws an error if this number is 0. If this value is 1, returns an array containing the starting point of this curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array of curve positions. The first
element will be the start of the curve. If "count" is 2 or greater, the last element
will be the end of the curve. (Type: Array.&lt;Array.&lt;number>>)<a name='H3DU.BezierCurve_jerk'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BezierCurve#jerk(u)</h3>Finds an approximate jerk vector at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>jerk</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, does a numerical differentiation using
the acceleration vector.<p>
The <b>jerk</b> of a curve is a vector which is the third-order derivative of the curve's position at the given coordinate. The vector returned by this method <i>should not</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">unit vector</a>.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing a jerk vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.BezierCurve_normal'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BezierCurve#normal(u)</h3>Finds an approximate principal normal vector at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>normal</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, does a numerical differentiation using the velocity vector.<p>
The <b>principal normal</b> of a curve is the derivative of the "normalized" velocity
vector divided by that derivative's length. The normal returned by this method
<i>should</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">unit vector</a>. (Compare with <a href="H3DU.Surface.html#H3DU.Surface_gradient">H3DU.Surface#gradient</a>.)<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing a normal vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.BezierCurve_tangent'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BezierCurve#tangent(u)</h3>Convenience method for finding an approximate tangent vector of this curve at the given U coordinate.
The <b>tangent vector</b> is the same as the velocity vector, but "normalized" to a unit vector.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing a normal vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.BezierCurve_toArcLengthParam'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BezierCurve#toArcLengthParam()</h3>Creates a curve evaluator object for a curve that follows the same
path as this one but has its U coordinates remapped to
an <i>arc length parameterization</i>. Arc length
parameterization allows for moving along a curve's path at a uniform
speed and for generating points which are spaced evenly along that
path -- both features are more difficult with most other kinds
of curve parameterization.<p>
The <i>end points</i> of the curve (obtained by calling the <code>endPoints</code>
method) will be (0, N), where N is the distance to the end of the curve from its
start.<p>
When converting to an arc length parameterization, the curve
should be continuous and have a speed greater than 0 at every
point on the curve. The arc length parameterization used in
this method is approximate.<h4> Return Value</h4>Return value. (Type: <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a>)<a name='H3DU.BezierCurve_velocity'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BezierCurve#velocity(u)</h3>Finds an approximate velocity vector at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>velocity</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, does a numerical differentiation using
the position (from the <code>evaluate</code> method).<p>
The <b>velocity</b> of a curve is a vector which is the derivative of the curve's position at the given coordinate. The vector returned by this method <i>should not</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">unit vector</a>.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing a velocity vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<p><a href='index.html'>Back to documentation index.</a></p></body></html>
