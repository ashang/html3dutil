<h3> H3DU.BSplineCurve(controlPoints, knots, [bits])</h3><p><b>Augments:</b> <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a></p>A <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">curve evaluator object</a> for a B-spline (basis spline) curve.
A B-spline curve consists of one or more <i>control points</i>, which more or less follow the path
of the curve, and a <i>knot vector</i>.
<p><b>B&eacute;zier Curves</b><p>
A B&eacute;zier curve is defined by a series of control points, where
the first and last control points define the end points of the curve, and
the remaining control points define the curve's shape, though they don't
necessarily cross the curve. An important property of these curves is
that the bounding box of the curve is contained within the bounding box
of the control points. Another important property is that the starting direction
is the same as the direction from the
first to the second control point, and the ending direction is the same as the
direction from the next-to-last to last control point.<p>
B&eacute;zier curves are a subset of B-spline curves
(see <a href="H3DU.BSplineCurve.html#H3DU.BSplineCurve.fromBezierCurve">H3DU.BSplineCurve.fromBezierCurve</a>).
<p><b>Non-Uniform Curves</b><p>
A non-uniform curve is one whose knot vector is not evenly spaced,
that is, the difference between one knot and the next isn't the same.
<p><b>Rational Curves</b><p>
A rational curve is an N-dimensional curve with N plus one coordinates
per control point (<i>homogeneous coordinates</i>). B-spline algorithms
work the same way with homogeneous coordinates as with conventional
coordinates, but if N-dimensional points are wanted, use the <a href="H3DU.BSplineCurve.html#H3DU.BSplineCurve.DIVIDE_BIT">H3DU.BSplineCurve.DIVIDE_BIT</a>
flag to divide each coordinate by the last (and omit the last coordinate)
to convert to N-dimensional points.<p>
Rational B-spline curves can describe circles and ellipses, which non-rational B-spline curves can't.<p>
Note that some B-spline packages define rational B-spline curves as using control points and weights, that is,
N-dimensional control points in conventional coordinates, along with a separate number, or <i>weight</i>,
for each control point. To convert such control points to homogeneous coordinates, multiply each
conventional coordinate by its weight, then append the weight as the control point's last coordinate.
<p><b>NURBS Curves</b><p>
<i>NURBS</i> is an acronym for non-uniform rational B-spline curves.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>controlPoints</code> (Type: Array.&lt;Array.&lt;number>>)<br>An array of control points. Each control point is an array with the same length as the other control points. It is assumed that the first control point's length represents the size of all the control points.<li><code>knots</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>Knot vector of the curve. Its size must be at least 2 plus the number of control points and not more than twice the number of control points.<br> The length of this parameter minus 1, minus the number of control points, represents the <i>degree</i> of the B-spline curve. For example, a degree-3 (cubic) B-spline curve contains eight knots, that is, four more knots than the number of control points (four). A degree of 1 results in straight line segments.<br> The knot vector must be a monotonically nondecreasing sequence, the first knot must not equal the last, and the same knot may not be repeated more than N+1 times at the beginning and end of the vector, or more than N times elsewhere, where N is the curve's degree. If the difference between one knot and the next isn't the same, the curve is considered a <i>non-uniform</i> B-spline curve. Usually the first knot will be 0 or less and the last knot will be 1 or greater.<br> If there are N times 2 knots with the first N knots equal to 0 and the rest equal to 1, where N is the number of control points, the control points describe a <i>B&eacute;zier</i> curve.<p><li><code>bits</code> (Type: number) (optional)<br>Bits for defining input and controlling output.

<a name='H3DU.BSplineCurve_accel'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BSplineCurve#accel(u)</h3>Finds an approximate acceleration vector at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>accel</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, does a numerical differentiation using
the velocity vector.<p>
The <b>acceleration</b> of a curve is a vector which is the second-order derivative of the curve's position at the given coordinate. The vector returned by this method <i>should not</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">unit vector</a>.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing an acceleration vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.BSplineCurve_arcLength'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BSplineCurve#arcLength(u)</h3>Finds an approximate arc length (distance) between the start of this
curve and the point at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>arcLength</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, calculates a numerical integral using the velocity vector.<p>
The <b>arc length</b> function returns a number; if the curve is "smooth", this is the integral, from the starting point to <code>u</code>, of the length of the velocity vector.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>The approximate arc length of this curve at the given U coordinate. (Type: number)<a name='H3DU.BSplineCurve_changeEnds'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BSplineCurve#changeEnds(ep1, ep2)</h3>Creates a curve evaluator object for a curve that is generated using
the same formula as this one (and uses the same U coordinates),
but has a different set of end points.
For example, this method can be used to shrink the path of a curve
from [0, &pi;] to [0, &pi;/8].<p>
Note, however, that in general, shrinking
the range of a curve will not shrink the length of a curve
in the same proportion, unless the curve's path runs at
constant speed with respect to time. For example, shrinking the range of a curve
from [0, 1] to [0, 0.5] will not generally result in a curve that's exactly half as
long as the original curve.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>ep1</code> (Type: number)<br>New start point of the curve.<li><code>ep2</code> (Type: number)<br>New end point of the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>Return value.

The first
knot of the curve will be 0 and the last knot will be 1. (This is a change from previous
versions.) (Type: <a href="H3DU.BSplineCurve.html">H3DU.BSplineCurve</a>)<a name='H3DU.BSplineCurve.clampedKnots'></a>

except that with the knot vector curve will start and end at the first and last control points and will
be tangent to the line between the first and second control points
and to the line between the next-to-last and last control points.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>controlPoints</code> (Type: number | Object)<br>Number of control points the curve will have, or an array of control points.<li><code>degree</code> (Type: number) (optional)<br>Degree of the B-spline curve.

the starting and ending U coordinates, respectively, of the curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.BSplineCurve_evaluate'></a>
<h3> H3DU.BSplineCurve#evaluate(u)</h3>Evaluates the curve function based on a point
in a B-spline curve.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>Point on the curve to evaluate. NOTE: Since version 2.0, this parameter is no longer scaled according to the curve's knot vector. To get the curve's extents, call this object's <code>endPoints</code> method.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array of the result of
the evaluation. Its length will be equal to the
length of a control point (minus 1 if DIVIDE_BIT is set), as specified in the constructor. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<h4> Example</h4><pre>// Generate 11 points forming the curve.

<h3> H3DU.BSplineCurve#fitRange(ep1, ep2)</h3>Creates a curve evaluator object for a curve that follows the same
path as this one but has its U coordinates remapped to fit the given range.
For example, this method can be used to shrink the range of U coordinates
from [-&pi;, &pi;] to [0, 1] without shortening the path of the curve.
Here, -&pi; now maps to 0, and &pi; now maps to 1.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>ep1</code> (Type: number)<br>New value to use as the start point of the curve.<li><code>ep2</code> (Type: number)<br>New value to use as the end point of the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>Return value.

evenly spaced along the curve unless the curve uses
an arc-length parameterization.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>count</code> (Type: number)<br>Number of positions to generate. Throws an error if this number is 0. If this value is 1, returns an array containing the starting point of this curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array of curve positions. The first
element will be the start of the curve. If "count" is 2 or greater, the last element

<h3> H3DU.BSplineCurve#jerk(u)</h3>Finds an approximate jerk vector at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>jerk</code>
