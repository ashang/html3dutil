<h3> H3DU.Surface(surface)</h3>A surface evaluator object for a parametric surface.<p>
A parametric surface is a surface whose points are based on a
parametric surface function. A surface function takes two numbers
(U and V) and returns a point (in 1, 2, 3 or more dimensions, but
usually 2 or 3) that lies on the surface. For example, in 3
dimensions, a surface function has the following form:<p>
<b>F</b>(u, v) = [ x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v) ]<p>
where x(u, v) returns an X coordinate, y(u, v) a Y coordinate,
and z(u, v) returns a Z coordinate.<p>
Specialized surfaces should <a href="tutorial-subclass.html">subclass</a> this class and implement
the <code>evaluate</code> method and, optionally, the other methods mentioned in the "surface" parameter below.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>surface</code> (Type: Object)<br>A <b>surface evaluator object</b>, which is an object that must contain an <code>evaluate</code> method and may contain the <code>endPoints</code>, <code>tangent</code>, <code>bitangent</code>, and/or <code>gradient</code> methods, as described in the corresponding methods of this class.</ul><h3> Methods</h3><ul><li><a href='#H3DU.Surface_bitangent'>bitangent</a><br>Finds an approximate bitangent vector of this surface at the given U and V coordinates.<li><a href='#H3DU.Surface_endPoints'>endPoints</a><br>Returns the starting and ending U and V coordinates of this surface.<li><a href='#H3DU.Surface_evaluate'>evaluate</a><br>Finds the position of this surface at the given U and V coordinates.<li><a href='#H3DU.Surface_gradient'>gradient</a><br>Finds an approximate gradient vector of this surface at the given U and V coordinates.<li><a href='#H3DU.Surface_normal'>normal</a><br>Convenience method for finding an approximate normal vector of this surface at the given U and V coordinates.<li><a href='#H3DU.Surface_tangent'>tangent</a><br>Finds an approximate tangent vector of this surface at the given U and V coordinates.</ul><a name='H3DU.Surface_bitangent'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Surface#bitangent(u, v)</h3>Finds an approximate bitangent vector of this surface at the given U and V coordinates.<p>
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Surface.html">H3DU.Surface</a> calls the evaluator's <code>bitangent</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, does a numerical differentiation
with respect to the V axis using the <code>evaluate</code> method.<p>
The <b>bitangent vector</b> is the vector pointing in the direction of the V axis, or alternatively,
the partial derivative of the <code>evaluate</code> method with respect to <code>v</code>. The bitangent vector returned by this method <i>should not</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">unit vector</a>.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the surface.<li><code>v</code> (Type: number)<br>V coordinate of a point on the surface.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing a bitangent vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying surface. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.Surface_endPoints'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Surface#endPoints()</h3>Returns the starting and ending U and V coordinates of this surface.
This method calls the evaluator's <code>endPoints</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, returns <code>[0, 1, 0, 1]</code><h4> Return Value</h4>A four-element array. The first and second
elements are the starting and ending U coordinates, respectively, of the surface, and the third
and fourth elements are its starting and ending V coordinates.
Returns <code>[0, 1, 0, 1]</code> if the evaluator doesn't implement an <code>endPoints</code>
method.<a name='H3DU.Surface_evaluate'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Surface#evaluate(u, v)</h3>Finds the position of this surface at the given U and V coordinates.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the surface.<li><code>v</code> (Type: number)<br>V coordinate of a point on the surface.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing a position. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying surface. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.Surface_gradient'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Surface#gradient(u, v)</h3>Finds an approximate gradient vector of this surface at the given U and V coordinates.<p>
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Surface.html">H3DU.Surface</a> calls the evaluator's <code>gradient</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise uses the surface's tangent and bitangent vectors to implement the gradient
(however, this approach is generally only meaningful for a three-dimensional surface).<p>
The <b>gradient</b> is a vector pointing up and away from the surface.
If the evaluator describes a regular three-dimensional surface (usually
a continuous, unbroken surface such as a sphere, an open
cylinder, or a disk rotated in three dimensions), this can be the cross product
of the <a href="H3DU.Surface.html#H3DU.Surface_tangent">tangent vector</a>
and <a href="H3DU.Surface.html#H3DU.Surface_bitangent">bitangent vector</a>,
in that order. The gradient returned by this method <i>should not</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">unit vector</a>.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the surface.<li><code>v</code> (Type: number)<br>V coordinate of a point on the surface.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing a gradient vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying surface. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.Surface_normal'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Surface#normal(u, v)</h3>Convenience method for finding an approximate normal vector of this surface at the given U and V coordinates.
The <b>normal vector</b> is the same as the gradient vector, but "normalized" to a unit vector.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the surface.<li><code>v</code> (Type: number)<br>V coordinate of a point on the surface.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing a normal vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying surface. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.Surface_tangent'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Surface#tangent(u, v)</h3>Finds an approximate tangent vector of this surface at the given U and V coordinates.
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Surface.html">H3DU.Surface</a> calls the evaluator's <code>tangent</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, does a numerical differentiation
with respect to the U axis using the <code>evaluate</code> method.<p>
The <b>tangent vector</b> is the vector pointing in the direction of the U axis,
or alternatively, the partial derivative of the <code>evaluate</code> method with respect to <code>u</code>.
The tangent vector returned by this method <i>should not</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">unit vector</a>.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the surface.<li><code>v</code> (Type: number)<br>V coordinate of a point on the surface.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing a tangent vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying surface. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<p><a href='index.html'>Back to documentation index.</a></p></body></html>
