of shapes. Its reference, not a copy,
will be stored in the 3D scene's list of shapes.
Its parent will be set to no parent.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>shape</code> (Type: <a href="H3DU.Shape.html">H3DU.Shape</a> | <a href="H3DU.ShapeGroup.html">H3DU.ShapeGroup</a>)<br>A 3D shape.

to the scene's aspect ratio each time this batch is rendered.<p>
The near and far clipping planes will be set to -1 and 1, respectively.<p>

or squishing it.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>l</code> (Type: number)<br>Leftmost coordinate of the view rectangle.<li><code>r</code> (Type: number)<br>Rightmost coordinate of the view rectangle.

<h3> H3DU.Batch3D#orthoAspect(l, r, b, t, e, f)</h3>Uses an orthographic projection for this batch. It will be adjusted
to the scene's aspect ratio each time this batch is rendered.<p>
In this projection, the left clipping plane is parallel to the right clipping
plane and the top to the bottom.<p>
If the view rectangle's aspect ratio doesn't match the desired aspect
ratio, the view rectangle will be centered on the 3D scene's viewport
or otherwise moved and scaled so as to keep the entire view rectangle visible without stretching
or squishing it.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>l</code> (Type: number)<br>Leftmost coordinate of the view rectangle.<li><code>r</code> (Type: number)<br>Rightmost coordinate of the view rectangle. (Note that right can be greater than left or vice versa.)<li><code>b</code> (Type: number)<br>Bottommost coordinate of the view rectangle.<li><code>t</code> (Type: number)<br>Topmost coordinate of the view rectangle.

A positive value means the plane is in front of the viewer.<li><code>f</code> (Type: number)<br>Distance from the camera to the far clipping plane. A positive value means the plane is in front of the viewer. (Note that near can be greater than far or vice versa.) The absolute difference between near and far should be as small as the application can accept.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>This object.

Should be less than 180 degrees. (The smaller this number, the bigger close objects appear to be. As a result, zooming out can be implemented by raising this value, and zooming in by lowering it.)<li><code>near</code> (Type: number)<br>The distance from the camera to the near clipping plane. Objects closer than this distance won't be seen.<li><code>far</code> (Type: number)<br>The distance from the camera to the far clipping plane.

(<code>center</code>).<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>eye</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>A 3-element vector specifying the camera position in world space.<li><code>center</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>) (optional)<br>A 3-element vector specifying the point in world space that the camera is looking at. May be null or omitted, in which case the default is the coordinates (0,0,0).<li><code>up</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>) (optional)<br>A 3-element vector specifying the direction from the center of the camera to its top. This parameter may be null or omitted, in which case the default is the vector (0, 1, 0), the vector that results when the camera is held upright. This vector must not point in the same or opposite direction as the camera's view direction. (For best results, rotate the vector (0, 1, 0) so it points perpendicular to the camera's view direction.)</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>This object.
